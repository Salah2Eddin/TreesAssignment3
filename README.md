# Student Data Management

This program manages the data of students using different data structures such as Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Min Heap, and Max Heap. Each student has an ID, name, department, and GPA. The program provides functionalities to add students, remove students, search for students by ID, and print student information sorted by ID or GPA. It also generates department reports showing the number of students per department.

## Problem Description

The program stores student data in binary search trees (BST and AVL) and heaps (min heap and max heap). The key of the trees is the student ID. The program supports the following operations:

1. Add a student: Allows the user to enter the ID, name, GPA, and department of a student and adds it to the respective data structure.
2. Remove a student: Allows the user to remove a student from the data structure based on the ID.
3. Search for a student: Allows the user to search for a student using the ID and displays the student's information if found.
4. Print all and Department Report: Prints the information of all students sorted by ID and generates a report showing the number of students per department.

## Usage

To use the student data management program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd student-management`
3. Compile and run the program: `./student_manager`
4. Select the desired data structure from the main menu (BST, AVL, Min Heap, Max Heap).
5. Perform operations such as adding a student, removing a student, searching for a student, or printing student information.
6. Follow the prompts and provide the required information.
7. The program will display the results based on the chosen operation.

## Input File

In addition to interactive usage, the program can also read student data from an input file. The input file format should include the number of students followed by four lines per student: ID, name, GPA, and department. The program will store the objects from the file in the respective data structures.

## Requirements

This program requires a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard.
